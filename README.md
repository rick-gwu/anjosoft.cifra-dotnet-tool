# Cifra

v.1.0.0

This is the dotnet tool version of Cifra &#169;


This app provides real-time encryption/decryption of plain text.<br />
You may provide a secret key (password) or use a randomly generated one.<br />
Be sure to remember the secret key or to keep it in a safe place.<br />



You may encrypt plain text by typing, copying and pasting, or by providing the<br />
path to a file stored in your local device.



Cipher text and secret key will be displayed once encryption/decryption is complete.<br />
You will have the option to save the result to the local file system if desired.
